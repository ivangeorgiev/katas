## Problem

Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

```
             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
```

You need to create a function `sum_odd_numbers_from_row(n)`. The function takes a single integer argument *n*, calculates and returns the sum of the numbers in the *n*-th row of this triangle and returns. E.g.

```
>>> sum_odd_numbers_from_row(1)
1
>>> sum_odd_numbers_from_row(2)
8
>>> sum_odd_numbers_from_row(42)
74088
```

Solution should be implemented in at least one programming language of choice (e.g. Python - preferred, C#, JavaScript etc.) and in SQL.
